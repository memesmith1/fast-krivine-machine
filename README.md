# fast-krivine-machine
fast-krivine-machine is a lambda calculus interpreter written in python.

it beta reduces de brunin's indices

it was written to interpret the output of the new fastlisp compiler

it is named after Jean Loise Krivine who invented the krivine machine.

Eventually I may replace this with something that has higher performance like a g-machine or a graph machine.
